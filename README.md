# 3D Art Gallery

<img src="demo/art-gallery.gif" />

This is was created for ```Wallpaper Engine``` on ```Steam```
- The images/videos in the source are intended for ```2560x1080```
- Source code is from [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2179153203)
- This version is simply reducing the amount of images/videos and updating the content to fit my taste along with fixing some minor bugs from the original
- I am uploading this mainly for myself but also for those who might want to use it as well

To apply this to Wallpaper Engine:
- Download the folder titled ```3D Art Gallery```
- Open the application and click on ```Wallpaper Editor```
- You should have the option to ```Create Wallpaper```. You can either:
	- Click on ```Create Wallpaper``` and select ```index.html```
	- Drag the ```index.html``` file to the section labled ```Create Wallpaper```

If you want to change the images or videos themselves:
- Navigate to the ```3D Art Gallery``` folder and either select ```full_screen_images``` or ```full_screen_videos```
- Replace an image/video with whatever you want (make sure the name remains the same)
- Then you can update the associated file in ```images```
	- This is the preview image shown when no wallpaper is selected so make sure that the version in ```images``` is lower quality to reduce lag
